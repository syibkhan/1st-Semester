# How would you implement a page which shows a list of files. See also List keys.

I would create a page who send a request to get key in stream and show by default 5 or 6 files.
Each time people will scroll down, we will launch request with key from the stream to get more files.

The best option is to use an other database, where the access is optimize for huge informations.


# Why would you ever use a set-up with virtual machines in a real (production) environment? Or would you not?
Set-up virtual machines are extremely useful from the perspective of software development due to a number of reasons:
 -It is cost-efficient: setting up a virtual machine is free while buying a server for the purpose of testing makes no sense
 and we can optimize our resource usage.
 -Virtual machines make it easier to test different scenarios, for example the bad connection part of this weeks assignment
 -It is simply safer to test new functionality in a sandbox, which a set-up with virtual machines practically is

# Which of the optimizations made sense, which ones not?
Well, I am sure developer won't change their webServer to make an application faster, this kind of decision is made normally by project manager.
For my point of view to optimize an application load balancing is the best method(believe me I am not selecting it because it was cancelled from assignment).
you will handle request in a multi threaded environment and forward them into different channel to process the request.
And memcache can improve performance at a certain limit.
