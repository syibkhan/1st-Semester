Reflective Questions

15 	

--------------------

16 	

17 	

####Most REST services do not use WSDL and SOAP. What could be reasons for this?<br>

18 	

- REST mainly works with http and most programming languages have libraries for that. For SOAP this is not ensured.<br>

19 	

- SOAP is requests XML structures, whereas with REST you can also for example use JSON.<br>

20 	

- REST supports fixed data manipulation protocol (CRUD) with which you always work on objects. With SOAP you do not have this kind of manipulation protocol.<br>

21 	

22 	

####SOAP and WSDL use XML, would it be better if they would use something more modern like JSON?<br>

23 	

- This would not work, since JSON is schemaless and WSDL requires a schema to create the code automatically.<br>

24 	

25 	

####How did you handle errors and how should it be done? Imagine that your application is running on a production server.<br>

26 	

- Number Credit Input: there should be an error message showing the user, that the input should only be an integer.<br>

27 	

- For the command line program it's enough to show the exception, because the user can directly see them.<br>

28 	

  For the graphic user interface, exceptions should be caught and an error message should tell the users what went wrong.<br>
