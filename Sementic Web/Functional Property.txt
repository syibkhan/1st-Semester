 Functional Property
A functional property is a property that can only hold a single value for a given individual. 
For example, Bill's age is a functional property because Bill can only have a single age at a given point in time.



 Inverse Functional Property
A property is inverse functional if its inverse is a functional property. So, for example, a URL is an inverse functional property for a
 web page because there is only one page that corresponds to it (even if the page responds to multiple URLs). 


 Symmetric Property
A symmetric property is an object property that defines a symmetric relationship:
In mathematics, a binary relation R over a set X is symmetric if it holds for all a and b in X that if a is related to b then b is related to a. 


 Transitive Property

A transitive property is an object property that defines a transitive relationship:

So, for example, "ancestor" is a transitive relationship: if a is b's ancestor and b is c's ancestor, then a is c's ancestor. 

 Disjoint Class
If two (or more) classes are disjoint, they cannot have any members in common. For example, in the Pizza Ontology, NonVegetarianPizza and VegetarianPizza are disjoint classes.


 Creating Defined Classes

In Description Logics languages like OWL, classes can be either primitive or defined. Primitive classes only have necessary conditions, i.e., superclasses. Defined classes have necessary and sufficient conditions,
